Synopsis:

  -debug  : Providing that a PID is specified, then it will view the
            logfile if the talker crashed on that PID, displaying any
            commands used before the crash.  To find out what the PID
            was, using '.view -sys' will show you.

  -sys    : If a date isn't specified, it will show the system logfile,
            (any problems/errors with the talker, as well as any other
            relevant information.) for the current day.

  -staff  : If a date isn't specified, it shows the staff log, the log which
            contains any commands used by users of the wiz level or greater,
            and how they used them, for the current day.

  -login  : If a date isn't specified, it shows the login log, for the
            current day. (A logfile that monitors all traffic on and off
            the talker.)

  -email  : If a date isn't specified, it shows the email log for the
            current day. (A logfile that monitors any e-mail that was sent
            through the talker, and where it was sent to [not the actual
            message that was sent] as well as if any e-mail got auto-
            forwarded.

  -www    : If a date isn't specified, it shows the www log for the current
            day. (A logfile which monitors which users userfile webpages
            get updated, and stuff like that.)

  -capture: If a date isn't specified, it shows the capture log for the
            current day. This is the command a user uses in case they feel
            they are being harassed and want to prove to staff that they
            were being harassed. When a user uses the .capture command,
            it gets written to this file, allowing staff members to see
            what actually took place.
  
When specifying a date, it has to be in the format ####. The first 2
numbers are the month, and the second two numbers are the day. So if
I wanted to see the syslog for December 2nd, I would have to type:
.view -sys 1202.
