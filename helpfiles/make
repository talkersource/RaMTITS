Command Usage: .make [-social|-helpfile] [<name -delete>]
  
Synopsis:
  When the -social flag is used without any extra arguments, you will be
  prompted to enter 6 different lines.
      Line 1: The social name.
      Line 2: What to execute when the social is used by itself.
      Line 3: What to execute when the social is used on the same user
              executing the social. (ie, squirt types .hug squirt)
      Line 4: What to execute when the social is used on another user who is
              not in the same room. This line will display to the given user.
      Line 5: What to execute when the social is used on another user who is
              not in the same room. This line will display to the user using
              the social.
      Line 6: What to execute when the social is used on another user who is
              in the same room as the user using the social. This will be
              written to the entire room.
    Lines 2 3 4 and 5 require that your pass off a %s somewhere within the
    line, which will eventually be replaced with either the users name, or
    the given users name. You can only have one %s in each of those lines.
    Line 6 however, you need 2 (two) %s' one to pass off the given users name
    and one for the user executing the socials name. A sample of each of the
    lines is as follows:
      Line1: smoke
      Line2: ^~CT%s ^~FTtakes out a smoke and starts puffing away.
      Line3: ^~CT%s ^~FTtosses $G2self a smoke and puffs away happily.
      Line4: ^~CB-- ^~CT%s^~FT tosses you a smoke and a lighter.
      Line5: ^~CB-- ^~FTYou toss ^~CT%s^~FT a smoke and a lighter.
      Line6: ^~CT%s ^~FTtosses ^~CT%s^~FT a smoke and a lighter.
    You can also get the genders of the users with the following flags:
      $G1 = his/her/it for the user executing the social.
      $G2 = him/her/it for the user executing the social.
      $G3 = he/she/it  for the user executing the social.
      $G4 = his/her/it for the given user.
      $G5 = him/her/it for the given user.
      $G6 = he/she/it  for the given user.
  If you find that you have a social that you don't want anymore, you
  can also delete it by using the <name -delete> flag. For example:
  .make -social hug -delete would delete the 'hug' social providing that
  it exists in the first place.
~FT---------------
  When the -helpfile flag is used without any extra arguments, you will be
  prompted to enter the command name, and then thrown into the editor where
  you will be given 50 (fifty) lines to write a helpfile for the command
  that you specified. Optionally, you can delete certain helpfiles by using
  the <name -delete> flag, such as .make -helpfile make -delete which would
  delete this helpfile that you are reading. (I wouldn't do this if I were
  you as you'll find that this helpfile is one of the more informative ones)
