Synopsis:
  This command allows you to forward your s-mail to your e-mail address
  that you have set via the '.set' command.  To forward all of your s-mail
  in your s-mail box, to your e-mail address.. use the 'all' flag. For
  example '.fsmail all' will send all of your s-mail to your e-mail addy.
  To forward a specific message number, locate the number you would like
  to forward with the '.from' command, and then type: '.fsmail #' replacing
  the # sign with the number of the message you would like to forward.
  
  You can now forward any new s-mail to your e-mail address by turning on
  autoforward.. To use this, first make sure you have your proper e-mail
  address set via '.set email'. Then use '.fsmail -autofwd verify' and
  the talker will send an e-mail to the address you have set with your
  verification number. You can't turn autoforwarding on without this
  number.  Once you have the number, you can turn on the autoforwarding
  by typing: '.fsmail -autofwd on #' replacing the # sign with the
  verification number that you received.  If at any time you decide you
  don't want your s-mail forwarded automatically anymore, just type:
  '.fsmail -autofwd off' and this will turn it off. (You can turn it on
  again at a later point in time.
  
  Please be aware that once you change your e-mail address with the .set
  command, you will have to re-verify your e-mail address.
