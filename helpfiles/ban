Synopsis:
  This command basically bans/denies access to the talker from certain
  IP addresses/sites, or users.  The different flags, and what they mean 
  are:
    -site [site to ban]: This flag denies access to the talker completely
                         to the specified site. For example.. if you
                         banned the site 'netcom.ca' any person who tried
                         logging in with "netcom.ca" in their site won't
                         be able to connect to the talker.
    -new  [site to ban]: This flags denies access to the talker for new
                         user's connecting, and trying to create an
                         account. Works something like above.. except just
                         restricts new user's from connecting from the
                         specified site.
    -who  [site to ban]: This flag doesn't let anyone from the given site
                         to see whos on the talker.
    -user [user name]  : This denies access to the talker for the given
                         user. Whenever they try logging on, they will be
                         told that they have been banned from the talker.
  
  Wild flags are allowed, but to place a wild card, ie.. to ban multiple
  sites at once, you just need to specify the site.. and when connections
  are made to the talker, it checks the the whole sites string, and
  compares it to all the banned sites for each different category.
  Banning works better if the numeric site is given.. (ie 209.180.)
  seeing as how it also checks the users ip_site.
