Synopsis:
  
  When the ~CW'~CR-all~CW'~RS option is used, it wipes ALL of the messages on the message
  board on the room that the user is in.  If the ~CW'~CR-top~CW'~RS option is used, with
  a corresponding number, and the number is less than the amount of messages
  on the message board, it deletes the messages, starting at the top all the
  way down to the specified message number.  The ~CW'~CR-bottom~CW'~RS option is used
  pretty much the same way, but instead of deleting from the top, it deletes
  from the bottom.  If a sole number is given, it deletes that 1 message from
  the board.
  You can find the numbers of messages via the ~CW'~CR.bfrom~CW'~RS command.  You can also
  delete from a certain number to another certain number using this option:
  ~CR.wipe ~CB[~CRnumber - number~CB]~RS.  This deletes all of the messages, including the
  two specified numbers, between the two specified numbers.  You can also
  specifiy up to 5 messages you would like deleted by using the following:
  ~CR.wipe ~CB[~CRnumber number number~CB]~RS (include spaces between the message numbers)
  which will delete those specific messages from the message board.
