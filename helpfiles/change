Command Usage: .change -flag [arguments]

Synopsis:
  Please be aware that changing anything in here changes the config file,
  if you have any problems after changing anything with this command, please
  delete ~/ramtits-2.2/datafiles/config.talker
  ~CW'~CR-clones~CW '~CB:~RS Using this flag, and providing a valid number (between 1 and 6)
              this changes the max amount of clones that a user can have at
              one time.
              ~CRUsage~CB:~CR .change -clones ~CB[~CR1~CW -~CR 6~CB]

  ~CW'~CR-life~CW   '~CB:~RS Using this flag changes the amount of days before messages are
              wiped from the board. It can only be changed between 1 day and
              15 days.
              ~CRUsage~CB:~CR .change -life ~CB[~CR1~CW -~CR 15~CB]

  ~CW'~CR-mesg~CW   '~CB:~RS Using this flag changes the time that the talker does system
              maintenance, such as renaming logfiles, checking message boards,
              and backing up the talker. When using this flag make sure you
              enter a valid time.. (such as 13:30 for 1:30 pm.)
              ~CRUsage~CB:~CR .change -mesg ~CB[~CRHH:MM~CB]

  ~CW'~CR-users~CW  '~CB:~RS Using this flag changes the max amount of users that can be logged
              on at one time. Note that the more users connected to the talker,
              the more amount of memory (RAM) the talker consumes. The default
              is 50.
              ~CRUsage~CB:~CR .change -users ~CB[~CR10~CW - ~CR99~CB]

  ~CW'~CR-wizplev~CW'~CB:~RS Using this flag allows you to change which level may be allowed
              to log onto the staff port.
              ~CRUsage~CB:~CR .change -wizplev ~CB[~CRlevel~CB]

  ~CW'~CR-timeout~CW'~CB:~RS Using this flag allows you to change which level in which users
              will be timed out and logged off of the talker.
              ~CRUsage~CB:~CR .change -timeout ~CB[~CRlevel~CB]

  ~CW'~CR-char~CW   '~CB:~RS Using this flag allows you to set default character mode
              echoing on or off. This is mainly good if you know the type of
              telnet client that the majority of your users use.
              ~CRUsage~CB:~CR .change -char ~CB[~CRoff~CW|~CRon~CB]

  ~CW'~CR-prompt ~CW'~CB:~RS Using this flag allows you to set the prompt default on or off,
              which means that if a new user comes on, and you have the prompt
              default set to on, that user would be given a prompt. (Which just
              displays the time.)
              ~CRUsage~CB:~CR .change -prompt ~CB[~CRoff~CW|~CRon~CB]

  ~CW'~CR-backup ~CW'~CB:~RS Using this flag allows you to set the automatic talker backup
              on or off. Backups are stored wherever the pre-defined backup
              directory is. (Check defines.h)
              ~CRUsage~CB:~CR .change -backup ~CB[~CRoff~CW|~CRon~CB]

  ~CW'~CR-debug  ~CW'~CB:~RS Using this flag allows to to set the talker debugging on or
              off, which basically just generates a crash file, showing
              everything being done at the time of the crash. (Logins,
              people in editors, and what not.) This is good if you experience
              crashes and aren't sure what's crashing the talker. To view
              the debug log use ~CW'~CR.view -debug ~CB[~CRPID~CB]~CW'
              ~CRUsage~CB:~CR .change -debug ~CB[~CRoff~CW|~CRon~CB]

  ~CW'~CR-webpage~CW'~CB:~RS Using this flag allows you to turn the talker's webpage
              generator on or off. When the webpage generator is on, it will
              generate html files for users, and a who file, showing who
              is on the talker. (Providing that the talker webpage dir
              is properly defined in defines.h).
              ~CRUsage~CB:~CR .change -webpage~CB [~CRoff~CW|~CRon~CB]

  ~CW'~CR-auto   ~CW'~CB:~RS Using this flag allows you to turn auto authlookups on or off.
              When turned on, auth lookup attempts to connect to the user's
              computer and perform an ident request, attempting to get a real
              login name from the user's ISP. Which would provide useful
              if the user is being harassive. (To see the user's name,
              providing the auth lookup was successful, use the ~CR.getname
              command).
              ~CRUsage~CB:~CR .change -auto~CB [~CRoff~CW|~CRon~CB]

  ~CW'~CR-passwd ~CW'~CB:~RS Using this flag allows you to decide if you want passwords
              echoed at the login screen. If you decide no, then the user
              won't see anything when prompted for a password, otherwise,
              it'll show the user their password as they type it. Generally
              this should be set to no, so people can't see other's passwords
              as they log into a talker.
              ~CRUsage~CB:~CR .change -passwd~CB [~CRyes~CW|~CRno~CB]

  ~CW'~CR-afks   ~CW'~CB:~RS Using this flag allows you to decide if you want to time out
              people who are afk or not.  If you decide yes, then even if
              a user is away from keyboard, but are idle for an hour, they
              will get disconnected. If you decide no, then they will not
              be disconnected.
              ~CRUsage~CB:~CR .change -afks~CB [~CRyes~CW|~CRno~CB]

  ~CW'~CR-apromo ~CW'~CR:~RS Using this flag allows you to decide if you would like to
              use the auto-promote feature. Which when a new user connects
              to the talker, they will be taken through the new user setup
              and promoted once they logon, if it's set to yes. If it's set to
              no, the new user will still go through the new user setup, they
              just won't be promoted.
              ~CRUsage~CB:~CR .change -apromo ~CB[~CRyes~CW|~CRno~CB]

  ~CW'~CR-free   ~CW'~CB:~RS Using this flag lets you decide if you want to allow users
              to have free rooms or not. If set to yes, then the users
              will have their own room upon using ~CR.home~RS for the first time.
              If set to no, then in order to get their own room, they must
              purchase it from the store.
              ~CRUsage~CB:~CR .change -free ~CB[~CRyes~CW|~CRno~CB]

  ~CW'~CR-crash  ~CW'~CB:~RS Using this flag allows you to change the talker's defalt crash
              action. If ~CW'~CRsreb~CW'~RS is defined, then if the talker crashes, it
              will perform a seamless reboot, which will reboot the talker
              without losing any of the user's connections. If ~CW'~CRreb~CW'~RS is
              defined, then the talker will perform a hard reboot,
              disconnecting all the users and re-running the executable.
              if ~CW'~CRnone~CW'~RS is specified, it will disconnect all the users
              and shut itself down.  If ~CW'~CRign~CW'~RS is specified, then the
              talker will try to ignore the crash, and carry on normally.
              If that's the case, then the talker may become quite unstable
              afterwards and crash more often. Seamless reboot is best for
              this because users can carry on with whatever it was they were
              doing after a crash.
              ~CRUsage~CB:~CR .change -crash ~CB[~CRsreb~CW|~CRnone~CW|~CRign~CW|~CRreb~CB]
