Synopsis:
  If used with only the -buy or -sell options, and nothing else, and the user
  is using the RaMTITS menu system, the user will then be brought into the
  store menu (either for buying or selling) where they will be prompted for
  what they want to do. You can get a general idea on what the different
  choices are, and what you can buy / sell by reading below what the
  different command line options are. If you aren't using the menu system,
  then you will be given a list of options to use:

  Buying Items:

  ~CW'~CRroom~CW'~CB     :~RS This option, no extra arguments are required, this just allows
               the user to purchase their own personal room, providing that
               the talker doesn't give free rooms away.

  ~CW'~CRatmos~CW'~CB    :~RS This option, no extra arguments are required, this allows a
               user to buy atmospherics to personalize their rooms. See
               ~CW'~CR.h atmos~CW'~RS to learn how to set them once you buy them.

  ~CW'~CRcarriage~CW'~CB :~RS This option, no extra arguments are required, this allows a
               user to buy a horse carriage so that they can move around the
               talker without having to follow the room's links.

  ~CW'~CRhat~CW'~CB      :~RS This option, no extra arguments are required, this allows a
               user to buy a hat, which basically just changes their text
               colour in all speech commands they use. You can change your
               colour any time afterwards by using the ~CW'~CR.hatcolour~CW'~RS command.

  ~CW'~CRcondoms~CW'~CB  :~RS This option, no extra arguments are required, this allows a
               user to buy condoms so that they can ~CW'~CR.netsex~CW'~RS other users.

  ~CW'~CRchips~CW'~CB    :~RS This option, extra arguments are required, you must specify
               how many chips you would like to buy. Chips are used in all
               of the gambling games.

  ~CW'~CRbguard~CW'~CB   :~RS This option, no extra arguments are required, this allows a
               user to buy a bodyguard, which will help (but not always)
               protect a user when someone tries to ~CW'~CR.steal~CW'~RS from them.

  ~CW'~CRnukes~CW'~CB    :~RS This option, no extra arguments are required, this allows a
               user to buy a nuclear bomb, which then allows the user to
               use the ~CW'~CR.nbomb~CW'~RS command.

  ~CW'~CRbullets~CW'~CB  :~RS This option, no extra arguments are required, this allows a
               user to buy bullets so they can play the ~CW'~CR.rroul~CW'~RS game.

  ~CW'~CRkey~CW'~CB      :~RS This option, no extra arguments are required, this allows a
               user to buy a key. Having a key allows you to basically give
               a user a permanent invite into your room. See ~CW'~CR.h rmkey~CW'~RS.

  ~CW'~CRpet~CW'~CB      :~RS This option, no extra arguments are required, this allows a
               user to buy a pet to play with. Pet's can be smart.. it's up
               to you to train it and stuff.. See ~CW'~CR.h pet~CW'~RS.

  ~CW'~CRbeer~CW'~CB     :~RS This option, no extra arguments are required, this allows a
               user to buy some beer. Once you have some beer, you can
               get drunk using the ~CW'~CR.drink~CW'~RS command.

  Selling Items:

  ~CW'~CRroom~CW'     ~CB:~RS This option allows you to sell your room. No extra options
               are required.

  ~CW'~CRcarriage~CW' ~CB:~RS This option allows you to sell your horse carriage. No extra
               options are required.

  ~CW'~CRhat~CW'      ~CB:~RS This option allows you to sell your coloured hat. No extra
               options are required.

  ~CW'~CRbguard~CW'   ~CB:~RS This option allows you to sell your body guard. No extra
               options are required.

  ~CW'~CRnukes~CW'    ~CB:~RS This option allows you to sell your nuclear bomb. No extra
               options are required.

  ~CW'~CRpet~CW'      ~CB:~RS This option allows you to sell your pet.. sheesh.. can't
               you handle a little extra responsibility.. you should be
               shot for even thinking about doing this.

  ~CW'~CRchips~CW'    ~CB:~RS This option lets you sell your chips back for money. You
               must specify on the command line how many of your chips you
               would like to sell.

  The ~CW'~CR-inventory~CW'~RS option is pretty much self explanatory. To see which
  items you own, you would use this option.
