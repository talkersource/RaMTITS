Command Usage: .entpro
Command Usage: .entpro [-read|-delete]
  
Synopsis:
  If no flags are given, and .entpro is used by itself, then you will
  enter the editor where you may enter up a profile / description of
  yourself.
  If you use the -read flag, then you can read your current profile
  without having to ~FY.examine~RS yourself.
  If you use the -delete flag, the you can remove your current profile,
  without entering a blank line in the editor.
  Also note, that in case you come across an error in your profile, rather
  then having to type the whole thing out again, you can type .entpro
  and at the prompt, type ~CW'~FR.l~CW'~RS providing you use the RaMTITS
  editor, and it will load your old profile into memory.

  NOTE: If the talker is using the webpage generator, your profile can
        contain html tags. This is useful in case you want to have an
        <img src tag inside of your profile, but don't want everyone in
        the talker who .examine's you to see it.  The talker ignores everything
        between the [HTML] and [/HTML] flags in a profile when someone
        .ex's another user.  To use these tags, while you're in the editor,
        enter something like:

        [HTML]
        <img src="http://www.ramtits.ca/mypicture.jpg" alt="My picture">
        [/HTML]

        Everything between the [HTML] and [/HTML] tags will only be written
        to your generated webpage file.
