Synopsis:
  This command is basically used to create rooms, delete them, change their
  recap, etc.  Seeing as how rooms are now dynamically loaded, and stored
  almost the sameway as userfiles this is the only way to create new rooms.
  No more going through config files and storing 50+ rooms in memory that
  will never get used.

  ~CW'~CR-add ~CW'~CB :~RS This option allows the user to add a room, providing they enter
            a valid access type. Valid access types are:
              1] ~CRpublic~RS  - Room is open to all users, and access can't
                           be changed.
              2] ~CRprivate~RS - Room is open to staff members only.
              3] ~CRboth~RS    - Room is open to all users, but the room can
                           be set to private by a user.
              4] ~CRhide~RS    - Room is set to hidden, but users can enter it,
                           and lock it if they want.
            The room name can contain spaces, and special characters, but
            it is advised if you keep it alphabetized characters, and
            numbers only.

  ~CW'~CR-del ~CW' ~CB:~RS Providing you specify a valid room name with this option, this
            option allows you to delete a room from the talker.

  ~CW'~CR-link~CW'~CB :~RS This option allows you link the room you are currently in to
            the given room name, providing you enter a valid room name.
            Please note, that when linking rooms, you have to enter each
            room to link them to one another.

  ~CW'~CR-rec ~CW'~CB :~RS This option allows you to recap the name of the room that you
            are currently in, so that you can add colours and what not to
            it.

  ~CW'~CR-map ~CW'~CB :~RS This option allows you to enter the map of the room, in case
            you use the multiple map system that RaMTITS has to offer.
            Don't use this option if you don't know what you're doing.
