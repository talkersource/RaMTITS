Synopsis:
  If the command is used by itself, then it will bring the user into
  the editor, where they can enter a message, usually relating to
  staff commands being used, or any staff related matters.
  
  If the -from flag is used, it displays the number of wiznotes that
  there are, as well as who they are from, and the number of the
  message.
  
  If the -read flag, and a number is specified, it allows the user to
  read a specific wiznote message. If no number is specified, then it
  will display the whole wiznote board to the user.
  
  If the -delete flag is used, as well as the proper arguments, then
  the specified messages will be deleted. (For more information on this,
  see .h wipe.) To see the full list of arguments that can be used with
  the -delete flag, use the -delete flag with no arguments specified
  on the command line (.wiznote -delete).
  
  The wiznote command is helpful for trying to keep track of why staff
  commands were used, or for keeping in touch with staff members about
  certain topics, or users.
