Command Usage: .sreboot [<seconds to reboot>]
Command Usage: .sreboot -cancel
  
Synopsis:
  If a time in seconds is not given, then it will prompt the user to if
  they actually DO want to reboot the talker and the user must respond
  with YES, or NO. If the user chooses to reboot it, then it will save
  all the data within the talker, including userfiles, and perform the
  seamless reboot as it should. If a time in seconds IS given, then it
  again will prompt the user, to which if they choose yes, it will start
  a countdown, and reboot the talker after the time is up. If the time
  in seconds is over a minute, it will display a warning every minute
  otherwise, it will display the warning every ten seconds.
  If the -cancel flag is used, and the countdown is currently active for
  the SREBOOT (not to be confused with shutdown, or reboot) it will cancel
  the seamless reboot, and things will operate as per normal. The difference
  between a seamless reboot and a normal reboot is the seamless reboot
  re-runs the executable without disconnecting users.

  NOTE: IF YOU CHANGE ANYTHING WITHIN THE USER STRUCTURE YOU MUST DO A HARD
        REBOOT, OTHERWISE ALL USERS LOGGED ONTO THE TALKER WILL HAVE THEIR
        USERFILES CORRUPTED!!!!!
