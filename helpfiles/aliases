Command Usage: .aliases [alias name] [what to execute]
  
Synopsis:
  This command allows a user to more or less shorten commands that they
  feel have to many arguments (such as .cbuff, .review, etc), or allows
  them to set up an alias for something to execute a greeting to everyone.
  If no extra options are given on the command line, then this command
  displays a list of the user's aliases that they have already set.
  
  To set an alias:
    Setting an alias is rather easy, you just type:
    ~CW'~CR.alias name what to execute~CW'
    ~FGFor example:
    ~CR.alias hihi ;waves hihi to everyone
    Setting an alias such as this would make it so that if you were to
    type ~CW'~CR.hihi~CW'~RS after setting this alias it would execute:
    ~CW'~CR;waves hihi to everyone~CW'~RS (which would emote that to the room that
    the user is currently in.  There are special options allowed in
    aliases, such as the $# flags ($1, $2, etc). The $# flags get
    replaced by whatever you specify on the command line along with your
    alias. ~FGFor example:
    ~CR.alias hihi ;waves hihi to $1
    Setting this alias would make it so that if you were to type:
    ~CW'~CR.hihi squirt~CW'
    it would execute:
    ~CW'~CR;waves hihi to squirt~CW'~RS (replacing the $1 with squirt).
    This command can be fairly powerful, providing you figure out all
    the extra options, such as && (which allows executing more than one
    command). Play around with it.. you'll probably like it.
  
  To delete an alias:
    Deleting an alias is simple, just type:
    ~CW'~CR.aliases # -delete~CW'~RS where the number sign is replaced by the
    number of the alias you would like to delete. To see which numbers
    correspond with your aliases, use ~CW'~CR.aliases~CW'~RS alone with no extra
    options.
