Synopsis:
  If a user is specified, then it offers a battleship challenge to the
  given user.  Once the challenge is issued, the user can accept the game
  with ~CR.bship -accept~RS or similarily reject the game by using the
  ~CR.bship -reject~RS flag.  If the user accepts the game, then both users
  playing can choose their ship layouts by using ~CR.bship -random~RS and
  continue choosing their layout until they are satisfied. Once they are
  ready, they can type ~CR.bship -ready~RS to let their opponent know that
  they are ready to play the game. Once both players are ready to play, it
  will start the game. The object of the game is to try and sink all of
  your opponents ships before they sink yours. To choose where you want
  to attack you would use ~CR.bship ~CB[~CRletter~CB][~CR#~CB]~RS with the
  letter and number corresponding to that on the grid layout. The
  game can be finished by either of two ways.. either opponent typing
  ~CR.bship -quit~RS during any moment of the game, or by an opponent sinking
  all of their opponent's ships.  If you ever loose your position of the
  board, you can bring back the grid, by typing ~CR.bship~RS all by itself.
