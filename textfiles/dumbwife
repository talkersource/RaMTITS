                               Dumb wives

Three construction workers are sitting around on lunch one day
discussing how dumb their wives are..

The Irishman say's, "My wife is so dumb, it takes her 2 hours to watch
60 minutes!"

The Frenchman say's, "That's pretty dumb, but my wife thinks that Taco
Bell is the Mexican Phone Company!"

The Pollock say's, "Your wives are all dumb, but I got you beat. Every
year my wife and I take separate vacations. And every year she packs a
box of condoms...Talk about stupid, she doesn't even have a penis!!!"
