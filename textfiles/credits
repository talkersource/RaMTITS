    RaMTITS started out as a project in which myself, and Mike Irving set forth
on making a talker to which came with pretty much everything needed to run
the talker smoothly, as well as a lot of fun stuff for the users to play around
with. In case you don't know what RaMTITS stands for, it stands for:
 (R)ob (a)nd (M)ike's (T)elnet (I)nternet (T)alker (S)erver.
The following people Mike and myself would like to give thanks to, either for
code snippets, ideas, and/or help:
  ~FG   Nuke,  Nerfingdummy,  Cusack,  Reddawg,  House,  Khamael,  Blaze,
  ~FG   Mordeth, Eekthecat, and Bristol.
  ~FG   All the users of DragonS CovE who have used .suggest, and .bug. 
  ~FG   and anyone else who feels they may have contributed somewhat to the
  ~FG   development of RaMTITS.
  ~FG   A big thank you goes off to Andrew Collington (creator of Amnuts),
  ~FG   as well as Arnaud Abelard (creator of PARIS), for all their help in
  ~FG   the development of RaMTITS v2.2.
  RaMTITS is usually always undergoing modifications, to try and make it one
of the best talker codes out there, and as long as people keep sending in
their input, and what they think needs to be changed or added, I feel that
it can and will be the best out there ;-).
If you would like to contact either myself or Mike, then feel free to e-mail
