POP
 
 A guy is going on a tour of a factory that produces various latex products.
 At the first stop, he is shown the machine that manufactures baby-bottle
 nipples. The machine makes a loud "hiss-pop" noise. "The hiss is the rubber
 being injected into the mold," explains the guide. "The popping sound is
 the needle poking a hole in the end of the nipple."
 
 Later, the tour reaches the part of the factory where condoms are
 manufactured. The machine makes a "Hiss. Hiss. Hiss. Hiss-pop" noise. "Wait
 a minute!" says the man taking the tour. "I understand what the 'hiss,
 hiss,' is, but what's that 'pop' every so often?"
 
 "Oh, it's just the same as in the baby-bottle nipple machine," says the
 guide. "It pokes a hole in every fourth condom."
 
 "Well, that can't be good for the condoms!"
 
 "Yeah, but it's great for the baby-bottle nipple business!"
