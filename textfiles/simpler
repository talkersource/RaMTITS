Make Life Simpler
 
  Old telephone books make ideal personal address books.  Simply
  cross out the names and addresses of people you don't know.
 
  Fool other drivers into thinking you have an expensive car phone
  by holding an old TV or video remote control up to your ear and
  occasionally swerving across the road and  mounting the curb.
 
  Lose weight quickly by eating raw pork  and rancid tuna.  I found
  that the subsequent  food poisoning/diarrhea enabled me to lose
  12  pounds in only 2 days.
 
  Avoid parking tickets by leaving your windshield wipers turned to
  fast wipe whenever you leave your car parked illegally.
 
  No time for a bath?  Wrap yourself in masking tape and remove the
  dirt by simply peeling it off.
 
  Apply red nail polish to your nails before clipping them.  The
  red nails will be much easier to spot on your bathroom carpet.
  (Unless you have a red carpet, in which case a contrasting polish
  should be  selected).
 
  If a person is choking on an ice cube, don't panic.  Simply pour
  a jug of boiling water down their throat  and presto!  The
  blockage is almost instantly removed.
 
  Save on booze by drinking cold tea instead of whiskey.   The
  following morning you can create the effects of  hangover by
  drinking a thimble full of dish washing liquid and banging your
  head repeatedly on the  wall.
