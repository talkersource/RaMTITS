The Frog
 
 A lonely frog telephoned the Psychic Hotline and asked
 what his future holds.
 
 His Personal Psychic Advisor tells him: "You are going
 to meet a beautiful young girl who will want to know
 everything about you."
 
 The frog is thrilled, "This is great!
 
 "Will I meet her at a party?" he croaks.
 
 "No," says the psychic, "in biology class."
