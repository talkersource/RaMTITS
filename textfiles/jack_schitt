                                Jack Schitt

When someone says "You don't know Jack Schitt!" Now you'll know the
entire story.

Jack Schitt was the only son of Owe Schitt and Awe Schitt. Owe Schitt,
the fartiliser magnate, married Awe Schitt, who later ran a country hotel
The Kneedeep Inn.

Jack Schitt eventually married Noe Schitt and together they produced six
children. Sadly, their first child Holy Schitt passed away shortly after
birth. Next came twin sons, Deep Schitt and Dip Schitt. They then had two
Daughters, Fulla Schitt and Giva Schitt. Their last child, a son, was named
Bull.

As time went on, Deep Schitt married Dumb Schitt, a high school dropout.
Deep Schitt's twin brother, Dip Schitt, married Lotta Schitt, who gave
birth to a son, Chicken Schitt. Fulla Schitt and Givva Schitt married
the Happens brothers.

The Schitt-Happens children are Dawg Schitt, Byrd Schitt and Hawse
Schitt. Bull Schitt recently married a spicy Italian number, Pisa Schitt
and together they await the birth of their first child, Little Schitt.

So next time someone says "You don't know Jack Schitt!" you can say. "Not
only do I know Jack Schitt, but I know the entire family as well!"
