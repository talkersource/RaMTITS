                               He Snores

A traveller named John pulled into a little town for the night to find
every hotel room was taken. "You've got to have a room somewhere," he
pleaded, "Or just a bed - I don't care where."

"Well I do have a double room with one occupant," admitted the manager,
"And he might be glad to split the cost. But to tell you the truth, he
snores so loudly that people in adjoining rooms have complained. I'm
not sure it would be worth it to you."

"No problem," the tired traveller assured him, "I'll take it."

The next morning John came down to breakfast bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.
The manager was impressed. "No problem with the other guy snoring, then?"
he asked.

"Nope," John replied, "I shut him up in no time."

"How did you manage that?" asked the manager.

"He was already in bed, snoring away, when I came in the room," John said.
"I went over, gave him a kiss on the cheek, and said "Goodnight Beautiful."

"With that, he sat up all night watching me."
