Gas Men
 
        Two gas company servicemen, a senior training supervisor and a young
 trainee were out checking meters in a suburban neighbourhood. They parked
 their truck at the end of the alley and worked their way to the other end. At
 the last house a woman looking out her kitchen window watched the two men as
 they checked her gas meter.
 
         Finishing the meter check, the senior supervisor challenged his
 younger co-worker to a footrace down the alley back to the truck to prove that
 an older guy could outrun a younger one.
 
         As they came running up to the truck, they realized the lady from that
 last house was huffing and puffing right behind them. They stopped immediately
 and asked her what was wrong.
 
         Gasping for breath, she replied, "When I saw two gasmen running as
 hard as you two were, I figured I'd better run too!"
