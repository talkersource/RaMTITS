Lover
 
 "So let me get this straight," the prosecutor says to the defendant,
 "you came home from work early and found your wife in bed with a strange
 man."
 
 "That's correct,"  says the defendant.
 
 "Upon which," continues the prosecutor, "you take out a pistol and shoot
 your wife, killing her."
 
 "That's correct," says the defendant.
 
 "Then my question to you is, why did you shoot your wife and not her
 lover?" asked the prosecutor.
 
 "It seemed easier," replied the defendant, "than shooting a different man
 every day!"
