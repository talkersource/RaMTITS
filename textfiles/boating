Boating
 
 Last summer, down on Lake Isabella, located in the high desert an hour east
 of Bakersfield, a blonde, new to boating was having a problem.
 No matter how hard she tried, she just couldn't get her brand new
 22 ft Bayliner to perform.  It wouldn't get on a plane at all, and it was
 very sluggish in almost every maneuver, no matter how much power she
 applied.
 
 After about an hour of trying to make it go, she putted over to a nearby
 marina.  Maybe they could tell her what was wrong.  A thorough topside
 check revealed everything was in perfect working order.  The engine ran
 fine, the outdrive went up and down, and the prop was the correct size and
 pitch.
 
 So, one of the marina guys jumped in the water to check underneath the
 boat.  He came up choking on water, he was laughing so hard.
 Under the boat, still strapped securely in place, was the trailer.
