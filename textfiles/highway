    The doc told him that masturbating before sex often helped men last longer
during the act.  The man decided, "What the hell, I'll try it,"  He spent
the rest of the day thinking about where to do it.  He couldn't do it in his
office.  He thought about the restroom, but that was too open.  He
considered an alley, but figured that was too unsafe.  Finally, he realized
his solution.  On his way home, he pulled his truck over on the side of the
highway.  He got out and crawled underneath as if he was examining the
truck.  Satisfied with the privacy, he undid his pants and started to
masturbate.  He closed his eyes and thought of his lover.  As he grew closer
to orgasm, he felt a quick tug at the bottom of his pants.  Not wanting
to lose his mental fantasy or the orgasm, he kept his eyes shut and replied,
  "What?"
  He heard, "This is the police.  What's going on down there?"
  The man replied, "I'm checking out the rear axle, it's busted."
  Came the reply, "Well, you might as well check your brakes too while you're
down there,  because your truck rolled down the hill 5 minutes ago."
