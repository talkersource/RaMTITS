Politicians
 
    A bus of politicians is driving by a farm where a man lives alone. The bus
 driver, caught up in the beautiful scenery, loses control and crashes into the
 ditch. The man comes out and finding the politicians, buries them.
 
    The next day, the police are at the farm questioning the man. "So you
 buried all the politicians?" asked the police officer. "Were they all dead?"
 
    The man answered, "Some said they weren't, but you know how politicians
 lie."
