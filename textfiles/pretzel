                                Wrestling

Our story begins at the Olympics, specifically the wrestling event. It is
narrowed down to the Russian or the American for the gold medal.

Before the final match, the American wrestler's trainer came to him and
said, "Now don't forget all the research we've done on this Russian. He's
never lost a match because of this "pretzel" hold he has. Whatever you do,
don't let him get you in this hold! If he does, you're finished!"

The wrestler nodded in agreement. Now, to the match The American and the
Russian circled each other several times looking for an opening. All of a
sudden the Russian lunged forward, grabbing the American and wrapping him
up in the dreaded pretzel hold! A sigh of disappointment went up from the
crowd, and the trainer buried his face in his hands for he knew all was
lost. He couldn't watch the ending.

Suddenly there was a scream, a cheer from the crowd, and the trainer raised
his eye just in time to see the Russian flying up in the air. The
Russian's back hit the mat with a thud, and the American weakly collapsed
on top of him, getting the pin and winning the match.

The trainer was astounded! When he finally got the American wrestler
alone, he asks, "How did you ever get out of that hold? No one has ever
done it before!" The wrestler answered, "Well, I was ready to give up when
he got me in that hold, but at the last moment, I opened my eyes and saw
this pair of balls right in front of my face.

"I thought I had nothing to lose, so with my last ounce of strength I
stretched out my neck and bit those babies just as hard as I could.

"You'd be amazed how strong you get when you bite your own balls!"
