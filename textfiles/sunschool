Sunday School
 
 At Sunday School they were teaching how God created everything,
 including human beings.
 
 Little Johnny a child in the kindergarten class, seemed especially
 intent  when they told him how Eve was created out of one of Adam's
 ribs.
 
 Later in the week his mother noticed him lying down as though he were
 ill, and said,  "Johnny what is the matter?"
 
 Little Johnny responded, "I have a pain in my side. I think I'm going
 have a wife."
