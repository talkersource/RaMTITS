Johnny Answers
 
 Johnnie says, "I'm too smart for the first grade. My sister's in  the
 third grade and I'm smarter than she is! I think I should be in the third
 grade!"
 
 The teacher had had enough. As a result, she took Johnnie to the
 principal's office and explained Johnnie's request.
 
 While Johnnie waited in the outer office, the teacher explained the
 situation to the principal. The principal told Johnnie's teacher that he
 would give the boy a test and if Johnnie failed to answer any of the
 special questions he was to go back to the first grade and behave.
 
 The teacher agreed. Johnnie was brought into the room. The principal told
 Johnnie his terms and Johnnie agreed.
 
 Principal: "What is 3 x 3?"
 Johnnie: "9"
 Principal: "What is 6 x 6?"
 Johnnie: "36"
 Principal: "What is 9 x 9?"
 Johnnie: "81"
 
 And so it went with every question the principal thought a third grader
 should know. Johnnie appeared to have a strong case. The principal looked
 atthe teacher and told her, "I think Johnnie can go on to the third grade."
 
 The teacher, knowing Little Johnnie's tendency toward sexual
 wisecracks,said to the principal, "Let *me* ask him some questions before
 we make that decision?"
 
 The principal and Johnnie both agreed, Johnnie with a sly look on his
 face.
 
 The teacher began by asking, "What does a cow have 4 of that I have only 2 of?"
 
 Johnnie: "Legs."
 
 Teacher: "What is in your pants that you have but I do not have?"
 
 The principal's eyes open wide! Before he could stop Johnnie 's expected
 answer, Johnnie said, "Pockets."
 
 The principal breathed a sigh of relief and told the teacher, "I think we
 should put Johnnie in the fifth grade. I missed the last two questions
 myself!"
