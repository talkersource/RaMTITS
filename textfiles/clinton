   One Sunday morning, Chelsea burst into the living quarters at the White
House and said, "Dad! Mom! I have some great news for you! I am getting
married to the greatest hunk in Washington. He lives in Georgetown and
his name is Matt." After dinner, the President took Chelsea aside.
"Honey, I have to talk with you. Your Mother and I have been married a
long time. She's a wonderful wife but she's never offered much
excitement in the bedroom, so I have fooled around with other women a
lot. Matt is actually your half-brother, and I'm afraid out can't marry
him." Chelsea was heartbroken, but after eight months She eventually
started dating again. A year later she came home and very proudly
announced, "Robert asked me to marry him! We're getting married in
June." Again her father insisted on another private conversation and
broke the sad news. "Robert is your half-brother too, Honey. I'm awfully
sorry about this." Chelsea was furious! She finally decided to go to her
Mother and tell her. "Dad has done so much harm. I guess I'm never going
to get married," she complained. "Every time I fall in love, Dad tells
me the guy is my half-brother." Hillary just shook her head. Don't pay
any attention to what he says dear. He's not really your father."
