                      Death of the Energizer Bunny !

(AP) The Energizer Bunny, known best for "going and going and
going..." passed away last evening at 12:42am.

Upon completion of the autopsy early this morning, the chief medical
examiner ruled that the death was caused by acute cardiac arrest,
induced by sexual over-stimulation.

Apparently, someone put the battery in backwards and the bunny kept
coming and coming and coming...

Foul play has not been ruled out.
