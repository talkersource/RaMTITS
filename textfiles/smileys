~CR   Basic Smileys
~CW   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   :-)    Your basic smiley. This smiley is used to inflect a sarcastic or
          joking statement since we can't hear voice inflection over e-mail.

   ;-)    Winky smiley. User just made a flirtatious and/or sarcastic
          remark. More of a "don't hit me for what I just said" smiley.
   
   :-(    Frowning smiley. User did not like that last statement or is upset
          or depressed about something.
   
   :-I    Indifferent smiley. Better than a :-( but not quite as good as a
          :-).
   
   :->    User just made a really biting sarcastic remark. Worse than a ;-).
   
   >:->   User just made a really devilish remark.
   
   >;->   Winky and devil combined. A very lewd remark was just made.
