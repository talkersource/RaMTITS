Where's the baby?
 
 For weeks a six-year old lad kept telling his
 first-grade teacher about the baby brother or
 sister that was expected at his house.
 
 One day the mother allowed the boy to feel the
 movements of the unborn child. The six-year
 old was obviously impressed, but made no
 comment.
 
 Furthermore, he stopped telling his teacher
 about the impending event. The teacher finally
 sat the boy on her lap and said, "Tommy,
 whatever has become of that baby brother or
 sister you were expecting at home?"
 
 Tommy burst into tears and confessed,
 "I think Mommy ate it!"
