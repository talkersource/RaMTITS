Organist
 
      The minister was preoccupied with thoughts of how he was going to ask
 the congregation to come up with more money than they were expecting for
 repairs to the church building.
 
      Therefore, he was annoyed to find that the regular organist was sick
 and a substitute had been brought in at the last minute.  The substitute
 wanted to know what to play.
 
      "Here's a copy of the service," he said impatiently.  "But you'll have
 to think of something to play after I make the announcement about the
 finances."

      During the service, the minister paused and said, "Brothers and
 Sisters, we are in great difficulty;  the roof repairs cost twice as much
 as we expected, and we need $4,000 more.  Any of you who can pledge $100 or
 more, please stand up."
 
      At that moment, the substitute organist played "The Star-Spangled
 Banner."

      And that is how the substitute organist became the permanent organist!
