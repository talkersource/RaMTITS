-		     Legal Information For RaMTITS v2.2		 	 -
--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--

	At first I was going to release RaMTITS v2.2 under the GNU General
Public License, but I was plagued with the fact that I would have had to
contact to many other authors to in fact agree with the license. One
author in particular, I know would not have approved of the GPL, hence
this is the License for RaMTITS v2.2 and any upcoming versions.

	This license is based on the PGPlus (http://pgplus.ewtoo.org)
license, (which in turn is based loosely on the licenses for SensiSummink,
PG96, and NUTS) as I found that it covered more or less what should be
covered in a good license. If you don't agree with the license, then you
should NOT use this code.

	1) The files/commands '.text credits' and '.text nuts' must
remain as they are, if you wish to add your own credits, I'd suggest you
create a file under the textfiles directory, and modify it to your own
liking (not under the name of 'credits' or 'nuts' as those names are
already taken [perhaps 'talker_name' would be a suitable file name]).

	2) You may re-distribute EXACT copies of the program's source
code as it was received, as long as the copy that you re-distribute
contains this license and a notice of the absence of any warranty. The
only time that you may charge a fee for this source is if the fee
will cover the shipping/handling costs of sending the source code.
Charging for the code/program itself is NOT permitted.

	3) You may modify your copy/copies of the program's source code
and re-distribute such modifications or work under section 2 above,
PROVIDED that you do not remove the original credits, and if a seperate
license exists, it must comply with this license.

	4) You may not add any commands that would allow you to 'snoop'
or infringe on another users privacy. This includes, but is not limited
to: Viewing users private messages (.tell, .pemote, etc); Reading other
users s-mail; Creating a command that will allow you to see another
users password; Or anything that would be taking away a users privacy.

	5) I have no problems with you charging users for an account
on your talker, say a 'VIP level' but you may NOT charge for the actual
code itself. No matter if someone offers you money for a copy that
you have modified, or for a copy that is still bare-bones.

	6) The '.version' command must remain in tact, if you wish to
modify this at all, perhaps with your own copy of the code's name,
then after the line:
writeus(user,"~CW  - ~FY %s ~FTtalker running version ~FM%s\n",TalkerRecap,VERSION);
add in your own credentials. (Leave the VERSION variable AS IT IS!)
There is nothing a programmer dislikes more than seeing their credits
removed due to the lack of consideration from some people thinking
that because they downloaded the source code, they can do whatever
they wish to it.

	7) The Ident daemon has a different license, and you
must follow the guidelines of that license if you wish to use them.
They can be found in the docs directory, under the names of:
~/ramtits-2.2/docs/LICENSE.ident

	8) If you would like to attempt to rip code out of this source
for your personal talker, you're more then welcome to, providing that you
GIVE CREDIT WHERE CREDIT IS DUE! A simple: "Thanks to such and such for
providing such and such command/function" in a credits file is enough.
I will not help you port the function(s) over though.. if you want to port
a function over, that is completely up to you to do.

	9) You agree to follow this license, and any subsequent versions
of this license that may follow.
