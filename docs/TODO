     These are some of the things I would like to do for future versions of
     RaMTITS, if you feel you could help in anyway.. let me know by
     e-mailing me at: squirt@ramtits.ca with any contributions you might
     have.  Coincidentally, if you have any suggestions.. post them on
     the suggestion forum (http://forum.ramtits.ca).

- Re-Do hidden things, perhaps have a user->contact array, with about 10
	different holding areas, so that if a user is hidden and they start
	talking to another user, the other user should be able to reply.

- Actual webport.

- Auto-Updater of sorts, probably web-based, it'll connect to something like
	http://updates.ramtits.ca, check if there's anything new, if so,
	download it, put it in a folder, and let the talker owner(s)/coder(s)
	know there's an update ready for install. Of course.. it'd be
	configured in the config file. This is just in a planning stage,
	if you like this idea, let me know.

- Have the command structure more generic, so things can be set through the
	talker with greater ease, and saved easier as well.  Might do this
	by dumping a binary .dat file (commands.dat) with any saved data
	for commands such as command level, command type, etc...
	IE: .command -level [command name] [level name]
		would change the command's level to the level specified.
	Just gotta think of a half decent way to save it...

- Also for the commands, re-do the command structure somewhat again, so
	it's has the following variables:
		command name		command level
		command type		command function
		command arguments
		(the stuff below would be new additions)
		command	jailed		(jailed users could use it)
		command muzzled		(muzzled users could use it)
		command gagged_shout	(users who are shout gagged could use it)
		command gagged_private	(users who are private message gagged could use it)
		command tpromo		(users who are temp promoted can use it)
		command shackled	(users who are shackled could use it)
		command clone		(clones could use it)
	Doing it this way would save ALOT of code if done properly... I could
	probably cut down the file sizes a fair bit too if I did this way..
	because if done this way... I would only need one if statement in
	the exec_com() function for each of these things, such as:
		if (cmd->jailed == 0 && is_jailed(user))
		{
			status_text(user,1,command[com_num].name);
			return;
		}
	instead of a whole slew of if (is_jailed(user)) calls inside each of
	the functions...

- Timed bans... dunno how I would work it quite yet... still in the planning.
