  README : backup

  OUTLINE:
    This readme is to give the person setting this code up a quick rundown
    on the procedures to get the backup script running properly with their
    shell account.  As I do not accept responsibility for whatever may
    happen to your code it's always safe to have a backup right?

	Although I feel I commented the backup script enough, I figured I
may need to make a quick README for it, just to give you a understanding
of what exactly the script does.  The reason I decided to do it from a
script like this is because if a bunch of talkers using the RaMTITS code,
never changed their mesg_check_time, then at around 1am in the morning,
all the talkers would begin their backup process. This could cause an
extreme jump in the servers resources, and thus pissing them off somewhat.
This script is basically designed to only backup some important things,
such as userfiles, datafiles, and source. As well as a few other things.
It doesn't compress the things that take up the majority of disk space
(unless you have an extremely large userbase).  Therefore, the server load
shouldn't be as high.  It generally is a good idea to change the mesg_check_time
in the config to reflect upon a less busy time of your server.

	In the backup script, you will have to define a few things, (Although
you shouldn't if you use the default backup installation path: (~/rt2.backup)
That folder gets created upon you running the quick.inst script to install
the source files. If you don't run the install script, you'll need to make
a directory (I'm using ~/rt2.backup as my default). To do this, simply type:

	mkdir ~/rt2.backup

And the directory will be made. Then, edit the backup script with your
favourite text editor, and read all of the comments (Any line beginning
with a '#' is a commented line.  The comments are pretty self explanatory,
but I'll go through them.  If your server doesn't have the $HOME variable
set, you'll need to uncomment the line that reads:

	#HOME=/home/login    so it looks like:
	HOME=/home/login

If you're not sure if your server has the environment set, simply type:
	echo $HOME
at your shell prompt, and you should see something like: /home/squirt
appear.  If all that's echoed back is $HOME then you'll need to set this.

	Next you need to tell the script where the code is.  It uses
the default path ($HOME/ramtits-2.2) as default.  If you've installed
it somewhere else, specify the directory where it says:

	TALKERDIR=$HOME/ramtits-2.2

	Now we need to know where to find the 'tar' command. If your server
doesn't have tar installed, or you'd rather 'zip' the file, please see below.
You need a somewhat more recent version of tar, one that supports the
-z (gzip) flag. If your not sure, type 'tar --version'  (I'm using:
tar (GNU tar) 1.13). If you're version of tar doesn't support the -z flag,
see the zip section below. Normally this command is stored in /usr/bin as it
comes with all major linux distributions, but if it's not in /usr/bin, you'll
have to change the location here:

	COMPRESS="/bin/tar -zvcf"

You can also change the file extension as well by changing the COMPEXT.


	If you'd rather use zip, comment (#) out the lines that associate
the COMPRESS and COMPEXT environments to tar, and uncomment the COMPRESS
and COMPEXT for zip, as well as provide a valid path to the zip command.
Normally the default for this should be ok.

	Next you have to specify where you want the files stored. This relates
to the directory we created at the top of this document (~/rt2.backup).
If you didn't use the default backup directory name, change the:

	BACKUPDIR=$HOME/rt2.backup

to wherever you want them stored.

	The rest of the script just writes the log file, and does the
actual compressing, and moving.  If you encounter any problems running the
script, let me know at the ramtits forum (address is below). Don't forget,
I'm developing these scripts on one different version of bash, and I don't
have access to a bunch of different shells.  I am willing to include any
modifications made to the scripts, but as far as I know they work for me.
