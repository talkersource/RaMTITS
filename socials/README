This readme is rather bland, because when socials are created, they should
be created through the talker itself, using the .make -social command. These
socials are 'soft' meaning once they are created, they will be able to be
used right away without having to reboot, PROVIDING that they are created
through the talker. The general format for the socials can be seen below.

Line1: User uses social by itself. (ie: Squirt types .hug)
Line2: User uses social on themself (ie: Squirt types .hug squirt)
Line3: User uses social on another user who isn't in the same room as them.
       This line gets sent to the other user.
Line4: User uses social on another user who isn't in the same room as them.
       This line gets sent to the user who executed the social.
Line5: User uses social on another user who IS in the same room as them.


So for example.. this is what the 'hug' social would look like:

%s holds $G1 arms open wide hoping someone will take pity and hug $G2!
%s wraps $G1 arms around $G2self attempting a one person hug!
=> %s smiles at you, leaning into you, hugging you tightly!
=> You lean into %s and hug $G5 oh so tight!
%s smiles at %s leaning into $G5 and hugs $G5 tightly!

If you need more help, log into the talker and type '.help make'.
