Rules for staff members:

~CT1~CB]~RS Abuse of staff level commands is forbidden, and just not right.
~CT2~CB]~RS If you see a new user logging in, and there are no other staff
   members in the main room, go out and offer a helping hand.
~CT3~CB]~RS Upon using a staff level command, post it on the staff board
   (using .wiznote).  Not doing so can result it the owner suspecting
   you of abusing commands.
~CT4~CB]~RS Regular user rules (.rules) apply to you as well.
~CT5~CB]~RS LEARN YOUR COMMANDS! The RaMTITS code base has plenty of commands
   which can baffle a user, sometimes even frighten them, so be sure that
   you know how to help a user with certain commands.
~CT6~CB]~RS Encourage others to come here (just don't advertise for your
   talker on DragonS CovE)!
~CT7~CB]~RS Do NOT bring problems from other talkers onto this talker.
~CT8~CB]~RS Don't advertise by going on 'busy' talkers and shouting the
   address for this one, this is known as 'spam' and you should be shot if
   you do this.
~CT9~CB]~RS Enjoy, and have fun :-)
