~FY                 Welcome to this talker running ~CRRaMTITS ~FYversion 2
~FT -==-==-==-==-==-==-==-==-==-==-==-==-==-==-==-==-==-==-==-==-==-==-==-==-==-==-
~FG      Hopefully this file will give you a brief synopsis of the different types
~FG  of things that users can do here. As this code offers a wide variety of
~FG  things that should attract pretty much anyone. With a wide variety of games,
~FG  such as battleship, poker, trivia, blackjack, tic tac toe, connect 4, and
~FG  quite a few others. What this file is going to attempt to do is give you
~FG  a brief understanding of the major commands, as well as how such things
~FG  as the pager (the thing at the bottom of your screen that says something
~FG  like):
    ~CB[~CR50%~CB]:[~CR1~CW/~CR3~CB] ~FGYour command: ~CB[~CRENTER~CW/~CRh~CW/~CRq~CW/~CRr~CW/~CRp~CW/~CRt~CW/~CRb~CW/~CR#~CB]: 
~FT                 --==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--
~FY                       The most widely used commands:
~FT                 --==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--
~FG      For starters, if you're used to ew-too, I would advise after reading this
~FG  file to type ~CW'~CR.set mode ewtoo~CW'~FG as you might find that style to be a bit more
~FG  to your liking. Or, if you're used to IRC, and all your commands starting
~FG  with a "/" then try ~CW'~CR.set mode irc~CW'~FG. I've tried to set this up so that people
~FG  used to different things can all feel familiar with something.

~CT      Private Messages:
~CB      -----------------
~FG        To send a private message to someone, you can either use ~CW'~CR.tell~CW'~FG or
~FG      ~CW'~CR.pemote~CW'~FG. The latter sends it in an emotion. The way you send the
~FG      message would be ~CW'~CR.tell <user> <message>~CW'~FG. So, if a user named Squirt,
~FG      wanted to send a message to Rob, telling them hi, you would just have
~FG      to type ~CW'~CR.t rob hi there :)~CW'~FG and it would write the message out to Rob,
~FG      and only Rob.

~CT      Normal Speech:
~CB      --------------
~FG        To just say something normally, providing you're in NUTS, or IRC mode,
~FG      (NUTS is default) then you would just have to type in what you want to
~FG      say, and hit enter. This will write out to the room that you're in
~FG      what you just entered. You can also send things in a possesive way,
~FG      by using the ~CW'~CR.emote~CW'~FG command. For example, if Squirt just logged on,
~FG      and wanted to say hi to everyone in the room, he would just have to type
~FG      ~CW'~CR.emote waves hihi all~CW'~FG and it would write to the room:
~FG      ~CW'~CRSquirt waves hihi all~CW'~FG.

~CT      Colours:
~CB      --------
~FG        Some people find a lot of colours offensive and that's why you are
~FG      prompted when you first connect whether you would like to have colour
~FG      on or off. However, once you log on, if you change your mind, you can
~FG      always type ~CW'~CR.set colour on/off~CW'~FG and toggle whether or not you want it
~FG      on or off.  For a full list of colours and how to use them, read
~FG      ~CW'~CR.text colours~CW'~FG or ask a staff member for help.

~CT      S-mail:
~CB      -------
~FG        Sometimes when you log onto the talker, you might get a message
~FG      telling you that you have new s-mail. If you find that you do, you
~FG      can type ~CW'~CR.rmail -new~CW'~FG to read all of your NEW s-mail, or optionally,
~FG      just ~CW'~CR.rmail~CW'~FG to read all your messages, including your new s-mail.
~FG      If you find that you only want to read a certain message number,
~FG      you can type ~CW'~CR.rmail #~CW'~FG (You can see the numbers of the message with
~FG      the ~CW'~CR.from~CW'~FG command).  Due to the fact that quite a few users let their
~FG      s-mail boxes fill up, users are only allowed a limited amount of s-mail,
~FG      a maximum of 25,000 bytes. Whenever you log on, or read your s-mail,
~FG      it will tell you how much you're using. You can also have new s-mail
~FG      forwarded to your e-mail address. To learn how, type ~CW'~CR.help fsmail~CW'
~FG      after you're done reading this file.

~CT      Editors:
~CB      --------
~FG        As of RaMTITS version 2, users have the choice between the old NUTS
~FG      style editor, or the new RaMTITS editor (the RaMTITS editor is default).
~FG      if you would like to change the editor, you just simply have to type:
~FG      ~CW'~CR.set editor nuts~CW/~CRramtits~CW'~FG to toggle which editor you would like to use.
~FG      Features of the RaMTITS editor include, 1) Being able to jump to certain
~FG      line numbers. 2) Deleting a line if you decide you don't want it there
~FG      any more. 3) Re-doing a line instead of having to re-start the whole
~FG      message again. For more help with the RaMTITS editor, when you're
~FG      in the editor, type ~CW'~CR.h~CW'~FG and it should display the help and the different
~FG      commands in which you may use.

~CT      Pager:
~CB      ------
~FG        Due to the fact that I got upset everytime I was reading a file, and
~FG      a bunch of people were talking, I decided to re-do it completely, so
~FG      not only will you ignore any outside speech while you're reading the file
~FG      but you have more options, such as if you want to jump to the bottom of
~FG      the file, you would just have to hit ~CW'~CRB~CW'~FG, or if you want to a certain
~FG      page number, you just have to enter the number of the page. To see all
~FG      the options there are, type ~CW'~CRH~CW'~FG now. (Don't worry.. after you read the
~FG      help, you can type ~CW'~CRR~CW'~FG to redraw the screen).

~FG      If you find yourself needing more help, and perhaps more of an overview
~FG  of what exactly you can do here, then ask a staff member, you can see the
~FG  ones logged on by typing ~CW'~CR.wizwho~CW'~FG or you can ask for express help
~FG  immediately providing that a staff member is online, by typing ~CW'~CR.helpme~CW'~FG. If
~FG  for any reason you need to contact me directly, as chances are I don't run
~FG  this talker, or have any ties with it, you can contact me at squirt@talker.org
~FG  via e-mail. Thanks for your time, and may you have an enjoyable time.
